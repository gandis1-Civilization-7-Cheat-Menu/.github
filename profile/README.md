## What Is the Civ 7 Cheat Menu?

The **cheat menu** is a hidden or modded in-game UI (sometimes console-based, sometimes trainer overlay) that gives you **one-click access** to core cheat functions. Think of it as a dev toolkit — but with the chaos dial cranked to 💯.

It lets you modify your empire live during gameplay, test wild strategies, recover from disasters, or just completely flex on the AI.
